# Nand2Tetris
Hello everyone!
This repository is for tracking my progress at course [nand2tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome)

## First week

This course has been very interesting so far, even though I completed only first unit. 

In the unit I learned about the Nand gate and other logic gates. 

I built 15 commonly used logic gates usidg NAND chip. During the assignmend I also reused logic gates to create other chips.
