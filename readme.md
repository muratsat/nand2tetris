# [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project02)
Hello everyone!
This repository is for tracking my progress at course [nand2tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome)

## First week

This course has been very interesting so far, even though I completed only first unit. 

In the unit I learned about the Nand gate and other logic gates. 

I built 15 commonly used logic gates usidg NAND chip. During the assignmend I also reused logic gates to create other chips.

## Second week
I really dived in to this course. It has been only three days since I started nand2tetris, but I have completed two assignments so far.

In the unit 2 I learned how negative number represented in binary, and it blew my mind. I think it is a brilliant idea to store binary numbers. 

I also learned how to implement number addition in binary using logic gates in the previous unit. 

I am very excited to start the unit 3.

## Week three
In unit 3 I learned how computers can memorize data and found out how RAM works.
